## HW2: Linear Discriminant Analysis, due date: Nov. 1, 23:59

### Goals
In hw2, you need to implement [Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis) by using only numpy, then train your implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data

Please note that only **NUMPY** can be used to implement your model, you will get no points by simply calling sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis

### Submission
- You should submit a compressed .zip file on E3-system with the filename below.
<STUDENT-ID>_HW<NUMBER>, e.g.0856165_HW1

- The compressed file should have **two files**, including your code (e.g. .py or .ipynb) and a report(.pdf) with your answer. Both files should be named as above.
