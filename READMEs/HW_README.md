# Homework README
In this course you will practice implementing and training machine learning model to solve severals machine learning problems, e.g. regression, classification. Also, we will learn neural network in this course, you can choose the deep learning framework which you are familiar with. If you are a newbie in deep learning framework, we recommend you learn Pytorch. **We strongly encourage students who are not familiar with Python or Pytorch/Keras/TensorFlow to complete the following tutorials first.**
- [Python/Numpy tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- [Pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
- [Keras tutorial](https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python)
- [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)

## Late Policy
We will deduct a late penalty of 20% per additional late day.

## Homework Grading Policy
You should submit 1) Code (.py/.ipynb) 2) Reports (**PDF format**) for every homework on the E3-system. Please follow the rules of each homework such as implementing algorithm by only numpy or writing Python code with PEP8 coding style.

## GPU Resources
You may need GPU to accelerate the training of deep nenural network. We provide several free GPU resources for you, some of resources need registration and limited by usage.
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb): Free GPU usage for continous 24 hours
- [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/): Registration for free GPU trials
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/)): Registration for free GPU trials
