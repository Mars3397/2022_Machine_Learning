## HW4: Support Vector Machine, due date: Nov. 29, 23:59

### Goals

In this coding assignment, you need to implement the Cross-validation and grid search by using only NumPy, then train the SVM model from scikit-learn by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data. 

Please note that only NumPy can be used to implement cross-validation and grid search, you will get no points by simply calling [sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV)
