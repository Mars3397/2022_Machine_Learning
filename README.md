### HW1: Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
In HW1, we need to implement `Linear Regression` by using only NumPy, then train our implemented model using Gradient Descent by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data.

<br>

### HW2: Linear Discriminant Analysis
In HW2, we need to implement `Fisher’s Linear Discriminant` by using only numpy, then train our implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data. 

<br>

### HW3: Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Random Forest
In HW3, we need to implement the `Decision Tree`, `AdaBoost` and `Random Forest` algorithm by using only NumPy, then train our implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data.

<br>

### HW4: Support Vector Machine
In HW4, we need to implement the `Cross-Validation` and `Grid Search` by using only NumPy, then train the SVM model from scikit-learn by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data.

<br>

### HW5: Deep Neural Network
In HW5, we need to implement the `Deep Neural Network` by any deep learning framework, e.g. Pytorch, TensorFlow, or Keras, and train the DNN model on [Captcha Hacker dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/captcha-hacker/data).

<br>

### Final Project: A Real-World Machine Learning Competition
In final project, we need to train a ML model to predict product failures by a [large testing study](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-aug-2022/overview)
