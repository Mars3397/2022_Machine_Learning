## HW3: Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Random Forest, due date: Nov. 15, 23:59

### Goals

In this coding assignment, you need to implement the Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Random Forest algorithm by using only NumPy, then train your implemented model by the provided dataset and test the performance with testing data. Find the sample code and data on the GitHub page.

Please note that only NumPy can be used to implement your model, you will get no points by simply calling sklearn.tree.DecsionTreeClassifier.
